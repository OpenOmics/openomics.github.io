# Welcome to OpenOmics

We're a community of bioinformaticians and computational biologists building reproducible Snakemake pipelines for genomics and multi-omics analysis.

## What We Do

**Reproducible Workflows** - Creating Snakemake pipelines for bioinformatics analysis

**Open Source** - All our pipelines are open source and community-driven  

**Best Practices** - Following scientific computing standards and containerization

## Our Snakemake Pipelines

Browse our collection of [Snakemake Pipelines](projects.md) designed for various genomics and omics analyses.

## Why Snakemake?

!!! tip "Workflow Management"

    Snakemake provides a readable Python-based workflow definition language and a powerful execution environment that scales from single workstations to HPC clusters and cloud environments.

??? info "Key Features"
    
    - **Reproducibility** - Conda/container integration ensures consistent results
    - **Scalability** - Run on laptops, HPC clusters, or cloud infrastructure
    - **Readability** - Python-based syntax is easy to learn and maintain
    - **Flexibility** - Supports various workflow patterns and tools
    
    All OpenOmics pipelines leverage these features for robust bioinformatics analysis!

## Get Started

Ready to use our pipelines? Check out our [Snakemake Pipelines](projects.md) page to explore available workflows.

1.  > Go to [documentation](https://zensical.org/docs/authoring/code-blocks/#code-annotations)

    Code annotations allow to attach notes to lines of code.

Code can also be highlighted inline: `#!python print("Hello, Python!")`.

## Content tabs

> Go to [documentation](https://zensical.org/docs/authoring/content-tabs/)

=== "Python"

    ``` python
    print("Hello from Python!")
    ```

=== "Rust"

    ``` rs
    println!("Hello from Rust!");
    ```

!!! warning "Needs configuration"
    Note that MathJax is included via a `script` tag on this page and is not
    configured in the generated default configuration to avoid including it
    in a pages that do not need it. See the documentation for details on how
    to configure it on all your pages if they are more Maths-heavy than these
    simple starter pages.

<script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://unpkg.com/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
<script>
  window.MathJax = {
    tex: {
      inlineMath: [["\\(", "\\)"]],
      displayMath: [["\\[", "\\]"]],
      processEscapes: true,
      processEnvironments: true
    },
    options: {
      ignoreHtmlClass: ".*|",
      processHtmlClass: "arithmatex"
    }
  };
</script>
