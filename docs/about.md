# About OpenOmics

We are a community of bioinformaticians, computational biologists, and data scientists committed to creating high-quality, reproducible Snakemake pipelines for genomics and multi-omics research.

## Our Mission

!!! quote ""

    To build reproducible, scalable, and well-documented bioinformatics workflows that accelerate scientific discovery and promote open science.

## Our Values

### :material-quality-high: Reproducibility

We prioritize reproducibility in every pipeline. Using Snakemake, containerization, and environment management, we ensure that analyses can be reliably reproduced across different systems and over time.

### :material-book-open-variant: Open Science

Open source is fundamental to scientific progress. We share our workflows, documentation, and knowledge openly with the research community.

### :material-account-group: Community

Science is collaborative. Our pipelines are built by researchers, for researchers, with input from the broader bioinformatics community.

### :material-scale-balance: Best Practices

We follow computational biology best practices, including version control, automated testing, comprehensive documentation, and adherence to workflow standards.

## What We Build

OpenOmics focuses on creating Snakemake workflows for:

- **Genomics** - DNA sequencing analysis pipelines
- **Transcriptomics** - RNA-seq and gene expression analysis
- **Epigenomics** - ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and methylation studies
- **Multi-omics** - Integrated analysis workflows
- **Variant Calling** - SNP and indel detection pipelines
- **Quality Control** - Data preprocessing and QC workflows

## Technology Stack

Our pipelines leverage:

- **Snakemake** - Workflow management
- **Conda/Mamba** - Environment management
- **Singularity/Docker** - Containerization
- **Git/GitHub** - Version control and collaboration
